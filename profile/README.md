# Duke Critical Care Datathon 2024 ðŸš€

Welcome to the Duke Critical Datathon 2024 GitHub!

The Datathon will take place on Apr 13-14 at the Duke Health Interprofessional Education (IPE) Building in Durham, NC.

This is the main hub for repositories that host various datathon projects, resources, and tools.

## Overview of Repositories :file_folder:

We believe that only reproducible, transparent research can help advance the field, so all our code will be made open-source by the end of the event!

Here's a brief overview of the repositories we've set up so far:

- **Team Repositories (team-1 to team-7)**: :chart_with_upwards_trend: These contain the codebase produced by each participating team.
